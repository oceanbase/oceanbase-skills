# Cluster and Component Upgrade

Use the supported upgrade workflow for a version transition that requires compatibility checks or upgrade scripts. Use [component-reinstall.md](component-reinstall.md) only for a supported artifact/release reassignment that is not an upgrade.

## Build the Upgrade Path

1. Record the current OBD build, product form, component/plugin versions, per-node binary versions/checksums, repository hashes, deployment configuration, topology, health, tenants, dependencies, and backup state.
2. Read the installed `obd cluster upgrade --help` and exact source/target component workflows.
3. Establish a version-matched supported path for every hop. Check OBD/plugin, OceanBase, OS/runtime, data format, OBProxy, OBAgent, monitoring, and Config Server compatibility as applicable.
4. Enumerate repository candidates for the final version and every intermediate upgrade hop by component, version, release, architecture, hash, and source. Select exactly one reviewed candidate per hop. Do not describe `--usable` as a strict hash selector: in inspected OBD code it is a priority list, and when none of its hashes match, resolution falls back to all non-disabled candidates. An absent requested hash can therefore select a different sole candidate.
5. For an exact-hash requirement, prove every selected hop hash exists and matches its component/version/release/architecture, freeze the candidate set against repository refresh or concurrent mutation, pass all reviewed hop hashes to the installed `--usable` list, and exclude every other candidate for the involved versions with `--disable`. Re-enumerate immediately before execution. If any selected hash can disappear, a new candidate can appear, or the installed build cannot make a no-match fail closed, stop: that build cannot satisfy an exact-hash upgrade safely.
6. Default to a rolling upgrade when the user did not specify an upgrade mode. Prove from the installed workflow that the selected path is rolling, then record order, health gates between units, expected mixed-version window, irreversible stage, and rollback artifact/data requirements. Do not ask the user to choose the default mode. If the installed path cannot perform a rolling upgrade, do not silently switch to component-wide or full-outage execution; report that limitation and stop unless the user explicitly requested another mode.
7. Inventory restorable backups and separately preserve metadata/configuration snapshots. When the observed cluster has no backup (`backup_jobs=0` or the version-equivalent inventory is empty), record that fact and continue by default: the explicit upgrade request accepts the no-backup recovery risk and does not require another confirmation or automatic backup creation. A package downgrade is not necessarily a data-format rollback.

## Preflight and Default Execution Consent

Refresh product-side topology, tenant and replication health, active workloads/tasks, disk/log capacity, package integrity, network/SSH, and dependency health. Define stop thresholds for each unit/hop.

Record the exact source and target identities, rolling sequence, client impact, backup evidence or confirmed absence, irreversible boundary, and recovery plan. An explicit request to perform the upgrade already authorizes the target version/artifact/configuration changes, rolling service restarts, and other persistent effects intrinsic to the proved path; do not request separate availability, configuration, persistent-change, or no-backup authorization. This does not authorize force, a non-rolling fallback, backup creation, destruction, or an unproved recovery action.

## Execute

Construct the command only from installed help, for example:

```bash
obd cluster upgrade <deploy_name> \
  --component=<component> \
  --version=<target_version> \
  --usable=<comma_separated_reviewed_hashes_for_every_hop> \
  --disable=<all_other_frozen_candidate_hashes_for_involved_versions>
```

This command shape is usable only after verifying the installed long options and the fail-closed candidate-set procedure above; `--usable` alone is insufficient. Preserve every trace ID. Between units or components, verify the expected version state, process/listener health, cluster topology, replication, and authenticated data plane before continuing.

## Acceptance

Verify:

- registered target version/release/hash and actual binary/package identity on every selected node;
- no unexpected mixed version, plugin, or repository state;
- process start times, listeners, OceanBase topology and upgrade status;
- authenticated SQL and representative read/write behavior;
- OBProxy, monitoring, and Config Server integrations selected by the deployment;
- configuration and tenant/data integrity, plus no unexplained residual task or artifact.

## Failure and Rollback

Stop the sequence at the first failed health gate. Preserve the trace, completed unit/hop, real versions, processes, logs, upgrade metadata, and data-plane state. Use only the version-matched documented resume/recover/rollback path.

Do not blindly rerun, reinstall the old RPM, force a downgrade, or restart every node. If the target workflow crossed an irreversible data/schema stage, report that boundary and use the proved recovery plan rather than describing binary replacement as rollback.
