# OCP Community Edition Deployment

Use this reference only after product selection resolves OCP Community Edition. The official OBD V4.6.0 guide documents management of OCP CE 4.2.1 or later and uses the component key `ocp-server-ce`; verify the installed OBD/plugin and repository because another build can differ. Commercial OCP uses a separate artifact/component and follows [the common OCP workflow](ocp.md), not this template.

For the preserved OCP CE/commercial OCP/OCP Express/obshell terminology and selection behavior, read [OCP product selection](ocp.md#product-selection). Do not substitute one product for another.

## Start from the Released Example

Use the example shipped by the resolved OBD installation:

- external/existing MetaDB: `example/ocp/ocp-only-example.yaml`;
- OceanBase, OBProxy, and OCP in one deployment: `example/ocp/distributed-with-obproxy-and-ocp-example.yaml`.

For an RPM/direct installation, examples are normally under `/usr/obd/example/`; for All-in-One, use that installation's `~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/obd/usr/obd/example/`. Copy one example to a new reviewed path and record its checksum. Do not mix the two topologies or use an example from another OBD installation.

## Choose Exactly One MetaDB Topology

### Existing or External MetaDB

The official V4.6.0 concrete-key baseline is:

```yaml
user:
  username: CHANGE_ME_SSH_USER
  key_file: CHANGE_ME_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH

ocp-server-ce:
  version: CHANGE_ME_OCP_CE_VERSION
  package_hash: CHANGE_ME_EXACT_OCP_PACKAGE_HASH
  servers:
    - CHANGE_ME_OCP_HOST
  global:
    home_path: CHANGE_ME_OCP_HOME
    soft_dir: CHANGE_ME_OCP_SOFTWARE_DIR
    log_dir: CHANGE_ME_OCP_LOG_DIR
    ocp_site_url: CHANGE_ME_REVIEWED_SITE_URL
    port: CHANGE_ME_OCP_PORT
    admin_password: CHANGE_ME_PROTECTED_LOCAL_VALUE
    memory_size: CHANGE_ME_OCP_MEMORY
    jdbc_url: CHANGE_ME_EXACT_METADB_JDBC_URL
    jdbc_username: CHANGE_ME_METADB_USER
    jdbc_password: CHANGE_ME_PROTECTED_LOCAL_VALUE
    ocp_meta_tenant:
      tenant_name: CHANGE_ME_META_TENANT
      max_cpu: CHANGE_ME_META_CPU
      memory_size: CHANGE_ME_META_MEMORY
    ocp_meta_username: CHANGE_ME_META_USER
    ocp_meta_password: CHANGE_ME_PROTECTED_LOCAL_VALUE
    ocp_meta_db: CHANGE_ME_META_DATABASE
    ocp_monitor_tenant:
      tenant_name: CHANGE_ME_MONITOR_TENANT
      max_cpu: CHANGE_ME_MONITOR_CPU
      memory_size: CHANGE_ME_MONITOR_MEMORY
    ocp_monitor_username: CHANGE_ME_MONITOR_USER
    ocp_monitor_password: CHANGE_ME_PROTECTED_LOCAL_VALUE
    ocp_monitor_db: CHANGE_ME_MONITOR_DATABASE
```

Before rendering, verify whether the selected plugin expects the named tenants/databases/users to exist or uses a privileged JDBC identity to create any of them. The V4.6.0 guide describes pre-creation for standalone OCP but also exposes tenant-definition fields, so do not infer behavior from YAML alone. Enumerate every database object and grant the workflow can create or change; stop if installed plugin evidence does not resolve the branch.

### MetaDB Managed in the Same Deployment

For this branch, the OCP component depends on the exact local components and must not contain `jdbc_url`, `jdbc_username`, or `jdbc_password`; the V4.6.0 guide says those fields conflict with dependency-derived MetaDB configuration.

```yaml
ocp-server-ce:
  version: CHANGE_ME_OCP_CE_VERSION
  package_hash: CHANGE_ME_EXACT_OCP_PACKAGE_HASH
  depends:
    - oceanbase-ce
    - obproxy-ce
  servers:
    - CHANGE_ME_OCP_HOST
  global:
    home_path: CHANGE_ME_OCP_HOME
    soft_dir: CHANGE_ME_OCP_SOFTWARE_DIR
    log_dir: CHANGE_ME_OCP_LOG_DIR
    ocp_site_url: CHANGE_ME_REVIEWED_SITE_URL
    port: CHANGE_ME_OCP_PORT
    admin_password: CHANGE_ME_PROTECTED_LOCAL_VALUE
    memory_size: CHANGE_ME_OCP_MEMORY
```

The associated `oceanbase-ce` stanza owns `ocp_meta_tenant`, `ocp_monitor_tenant`, their account/database settings, and the database resource budget in the V4.6.0 released example. Build those fields from the installed community schema and [community deployment blueprint](deployment-templates/community.md); do not duplicate them under `ocp-server-ce`. Add `obproxy-ce` only when the selected example/plugin requires it and the user accepted that component.

## Preflight, Execute, and Accept

In addition to the common deployment gate, verify `clockdiff`, Java/runtime requirements, OCP host resources, AVX/LSE rules for any bundled OceanBase nodes, exact artifact hashes, MetaDB capacity/backup, site URL/listener exposure, and every secret-bearing field. Render credentials only through the approved protected local procedure into a permission-controlled file.

Use the installed long-option syntax:

```bash
obd cluster deploy <deploy_name> --config=<reviewed_ocp_config.yaml>
obd cluster start <deploy_name> --strict-check
```

Apply the telemetry gate to both commands and use `--strict-check` only if installed start help supports it. Verify exact OCP artifact/process/listener/path ownership, authenticated administrator login, MetaDB connectivity and expected objects, OCP background tasks, and the requested management function. For same-deployment MetaDB, also verify OceanBase/OBProxy health and that exactly one intended OCP management relationship exists.

On partial failure, preserve the OBD trace, OCP task/logs, rendered configuration, MetaDB objects, account/grant state, processes/listeners, and current OCP records. Do not recreate tenants, switch MetaDB topology, load another package, delete an OCP record, or redeploy as generic recovery.

## Existing Cluster Takeover

This deployment reference does not replace the previously supported OCP takeover path. For an already running OBD-managed OceanBase cluster, use [Export an OBD Cluster to OCP](ocp.md#export-an-obd-cluster-to-ocp), including its utility-installation, credential-egress, task-state, and acceptance gates.

<a id="step-1-check-conditions"></a>

First apply that workflow's version-checked `check4ocp` conditions and classify any utility installation as a separate mutation.

<a id="step-2-export-to-ocp"></a>

Then use its protected, version-confirmed `export-to-ocp` procedure and verify the resulting OCP-managed cluster rather than treating command exit as takeover completion.
