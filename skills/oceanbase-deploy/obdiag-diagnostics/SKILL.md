# Diagnostics with obd obdiag

Choose the smallest evidence scope that can answer the question. Tool availability, tool installation, collection, analysis, a tool finding, and independently confirmed root cause are separate results.

Before any package network request, apply the shared [fixed mirror-source order](../obd-administration/references/mirror-and-repositories.md#fixed-online-package-source-order): actual controller-side acquisition from `https://mirrors.oceanbase.com` first, then the direct package directories under `https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase`, switching only after three failed attempts on the current mirror source. A generic Internet-connectivity test cannot precede or replace those attempts.

## Required Shared Gates

Read:

- [Product and capability resolution](../references/product-and-capability-resolution.md) before selecting an obdiag package, command, or target.
- [Operation contract](../references/operation-contract.md) before any live controller/host/deployment query, SSH/SQL/API/network access, installation, collection, scene update, artifact transfer, or another external action.
- [Completion criteria](../references/completion-criteria.md) before reporting collection, diagnosis, or root cause complete.
- [Failure recovery and evidence](../references/failure-recovery-and-evidence.md) before retrying a failed or interrupted diagnostic task or cleaning partial output.
- [Cleanup and ownership boundaries](../references/cleanup-boundaries.md) before removing diagnostic tools, generated files, collected evidence, or other artifacts.

Then read [workflows.md](references/workflows.md) for tool discovery, scope selection, execution, and interpretation rules.

## Tool Discovery

Identify the active OBD and obdiag versions using the installed command's normal inventory, help, or version paths. If invoking `obd obdiag` installs or updates the dynamic tool, record the resulting package identity and continue only when it is compatible with the requested diagnostic workflow.

If the tool is absent, install it through the supported [dynamic tool lifecycle](../obd-administration/references/tool-lifecycle.md) and verify the resulting executable and package version. Tool setup does not by itself authorize production collection; establish the diagnostic target and impact separately afterward.

## Diagnostic Boundary

Resolve the deployment, nodes, components, tenant when applicable, time window, evidence modules, output path, retention, expected size, data sensitivity, and runtime overhead before execution. Broad log collection, stack capture, performance sampling, or an all-module gather requires an impact review immediately before collection.

Do not present a rule, log pattern, check failure, or RCA suggestion as confirmed root cause until independent runtime, SQL/API, or system evidence corroborates it. Do not upload, delete, or broadly share diagnostic artifacts unless that action is separately in scope.
