# Common Test Workflow

Apply this workflow to Sysbench, TPC-H, TPC-C, and mysqltest. The selected tool reference adds its own data model, artifacts, and result checks.

## Capability and Toolchain

Read the shared [deployment package closure](../../references/deployment-package-sets.md) before resolving or acquiring the selected test toolchain.

Record the exact OBD executable/build, selected `obd test <tool> --help`, deployment/component/plugin identity, target server, OceanBase version, tenant, database, user, and test-tool versions.

Do not assume OBD always downloads a missing tool, and do not forbid package-manager installation universally. Depending on the installed OBD/plugin and repository state, a tool may be supplied by an OBD tool package, an OceanBase repository package, a local binary path, or a preinstalled external dependency. Resolve one reviewed source and record package name, version, release, architecture, hash, executable path, dependencies, download/install paths, and rollback.

Verified 4.7-era core paths can automatically install Sysbench/OBClient, TPC-H/OBClient, or JRE/TPC-C/OBClient when a dependency is absent. Check the expected source and paths, allow the supported prerequisite installation within the requested test workflow, then record the installed version, links, and profile changes. Re-inventory the resulting toolchain before interpreting test output.

Run an authenticated SQL preflight against the exact endpoint, tenant, user, and database. Verify the account has only the privileges needed by the selected prepare/run/cleanup stages. Do not assume an empty or default password.

Verified current plugins can place a database password in child-process arguments, verbose command logs, generated client commands, or tool configuration files. Prefer protected input; otherwise use a dedicated least-privilege short-lived test credential, restrict process/log/file access, and rotate or revoke it after the run. Do not copy the value into reusable commands or reports.

When a selected plugin constructs a child command as text, keep every value within the documented option format, avoid displaying the rendered secret-bearing command, and use a scoped test credential and permission-controlled execution environment. Preserve only redacted command evidence.

## Define Workload and Artifacts

Before execution, record:

- whether the target is disposable, reusable, or production-like;
- dataset/schema/table names and whether existing objects may be replaced;
- scale, concurrency, duration/event bound, and expected resource pressure;
- local and remote temporary, dataset, log, result, and report paths;
- free disk, memory, CPU, network, and log-disk headroom;
- artifacts to retain, reuse, or remove after the run.

Normalize every path and inspect pre-existing content and ownership. Do not let a generated-data or cleanup path overlap deployment data, logs, another run, or unrelated user files.

## Workload Bounds and Timeout Handling

A workload option such as Sysbench `--time`, TPC-C `--run-mins`, or mysqltest `--case-timeout` limits only the stage implemented by that option. Use native workload bounds and a reasonable caller-side timeout where useful, accounting for preparation, data generation, major freeze/merge, child processes, reporting, and parameter restoration.

If a timeout occurs, inspect the OBD process, relevant child processes, database tasks, generated files, and saved parameter baseline before retrying or cleaning. Do not assume that terminating the parent also stopped Java, OBClient, Sysbench, a remote command, or a database task.

## Control Benchmark Optimization

For Sysbench, TPC-H, and TPC-C, pass the installed long option explicitly. In verified OBD 4.7-era commands, `--optimization` accepts `0`, `1`, and `2`, defaults to `1`, and has these meanings:

- `0`: no OBD benchmark parameter optimization;
- `1`: change parameters classified by that plugin as not requiring restart;
- `2`: change additional parameters and potentially restart servers.

Treat those as version-specific facts and re-read installed help and plugin behavior. Use `--optimization=0` for the default baseline. It avoids OBD parameter tuning but does not make dataset preparation or the workload read-only.

Before level `1` or `2`, capture every parameter the installed plugin can change, current effective values, deployment health, and the plugin's apply/restore behavior. Verified current Sysbench, TPC-H, and TPC-C core paths restore the saved parameter values unconditionally in a `finally` path. Treat levels `1` and `2` as temporary tuning whose restoration is part of the same workflow, not an optional later cleanup.

Level `2` can restart servers while applying values and can restart them again while restoring the baseline. Obtain availability-impact authorization for both possible transitions after the final health check. If the user does not authorize the automatic restoration or either possible restart, do not run that OBD workflow. Afterward compare the effective values and process start times with the baseline even when the command failed.

Do not write the bare short option `-S`. In verified 4.7-era benchmark commands it means `--skip-cluster-status-check`, the opposite of deployment `--strict-check`. Keep status checking enabled. Use `--skip-cluster-status-check` only after explicit approval and an equivalent gate has verified all intended components, processes, listeners, tenant status, and SQL connectivity.

## Execute in Stages

Treat the applicable stages as separate even when a plugin combines them into one command. Sysbench, TPC-H, and TPC-C commonly use all five stages. For mysqltest, use preflight, optional initialization, run, and report by default; add a prepare/load or cleanup stage only when the installed plugin and reviewed test inputs actually define it, and mark inapplicable stages as `N/A` rather than inventing work:

1. **Preflight:** identity, health, authentication, toolchain, resources, paths, and baseline evidence.
2. **Prepare/load:** generate or locate data, create schema/tables, transfer files, and load data. Record exact objects and counts.
3. **Run:** execute the bounded requested workload while observing errors, latency, throughput, cluster health, and resource saturation.
4. **Report:** preserve raw output and produce a summary tied to exact inputs and versions.
5. **Cleanup/retain:** remove only approved run-owned objects, or preserve the reviewed reusable dataset and artifacts.

Before the cleanup/retain stage, apply [cleanup and ownership boundaries](../../references/cleanup-boundaries.md). Treat database objects, generated secret-bearing files, raw results, downloaded tools, shared caches, and controller profile/link changes as separate object classes.

Do not claim a phase was skipped merely because the CLI has no separate phase command. Inspect the installed workflow to determine what the invocation performs. A `test-only`, `init-only`, reuse, or similar option must be verified in installed help and against the actual dataset state.

Separate execution success from performance evaluation. Complete requested cases, queries, or stages; accepted error behavior; parseable artifacts; and post-test health determine whether the run executed successfully. TPS, QPS, latency, or similar metrics meet a target only when compared with a user-confirmed baseline, SLA, or version-matched acceptance standard. Without one, report the measured values and conditions without inventing a universal pass threshold.

## Non-Interactive Environment

Do not embed a permanent `obd env set IO_DEFAULT_CONFIRM 1` instruction in a test command. If unattended execution requires changing controller-wide auto-confirm or another OBD environment value, first read its presence and exact value, ensure no other task depends on it, obtain authorization, and restore the original present/absent state after the run. If restoration fails, stop and report the persistent controller change. Prefer command-local non-interactive behavior when the installed version provides it.

## Result and Retention Record

Record the redacted exact command, OBD/plugin/tool versions, target identities, dataset identity and checksum/counts, configuration, start/end time, exit code, trace ID, raw logs, result paths, error/failure counts, metrics, and post-test cluster/tenant health.

For a requested suite, continue independent cases when a case failure does not threaten data integrity or cluster health. Stop new load when the target becomes unhealthy, artifact identity becomes ambiguous, or a prior operation has unknown server-side state.

Before cleanup, show the exact run-owned database objects and filesystem paths. Preserve artifacts required to reproduce or audit the result. Never remove a reusable dataset, prior result, downloaded tool, shared cache, or unrelated temporary directory merely because the current run ended.
