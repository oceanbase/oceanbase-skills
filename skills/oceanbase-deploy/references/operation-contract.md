# Operation Contract

Apply this contract to every OceanBase/OBD workflow. Domain references add operation-specific checks; they do not weaken these rules.

## Evaluate Privilege Per Command

Do not run a root/sudo eligibility precheck before discovering or invoking an existing OBD, and do not make elevated privilege a prerequisite for cluster lifecycle, tenant, test, diagnostic, repository-inventory, or other operations that the established login-session user can perform. Run OBD under its resolved controller owner and evaluate permissions only when the workflow reaches an exact command that requires a protected host, package-manager, service, kernel, account, or filesystem mutation.

For such a command, use an already available narrowly scoped elevation path only when needed and keep the OBD/controller owner unchanged. If the exact mutation cannot be completed with the current access, report that step as `BLOCKED`, request only the missing access, and preserve or continue any unaffected in-scope work where safe. Never classify OBD or the whole Skill as unsupported solely because the login user is not root or has no usable sudo.

## Preserve the Requested Mode

Classify the request before taking action:

- **Explain/review/audit:** read-only analysis of supplied or already available evidence.
- **Diagnose:** bounded read-only inspection first; installation, high-overhead collection, and service changes remain separate.
- **Implement:** mutations limited to the reviewed target and outcome.

Here, read-only means no change to the supplied artifact, installed/controller state, deployment, target host, database, repository, network, or another external object. When a format cannot be inspected in place, a domain workflow may create only a new isolated local scratch directory under the approved workspace or temporary area, copy/extract into it without executing content, and remove only that scratch directory afterward—unless the user required strict zero-write analysis. Record this exception and its cleanup; it does not authorize a download, package installation, repository import, target-host write, or edit to the source artifact.

An OBD inventory command can initialize `OBD_HOME` and write controller-local traces. Treat those as ordinary CLI bookkeeping for a requested live inventory. If the user explicitly requires strict zero-write analysis, inspect already available files or output instead of invoking OBD.

Authorization for one mode or object does not authorize another. Ask again when new evidence requires a materially broader mutation.

## Default Consent for In-Scope Persistent Changes

An explicit request to execute a non-destructive workflow authorizes the ordinary persistent configuration, package, repository, host-setting, account-access, and service-state changes that are necessary and intrinsic to that requested outcome after their exact targets have been resolved. For an OBD-dependent cluster deployment, this specifically includes the proved first installation of `ob-deploy` on the selected clean controller with package-manager non-interactive acceptance, and the bounded controller-to-target public-key bootstrap defined below. Record those effects and verify them, but do not ask for a second confirmation merely because they persist across process exit or reboot.

This default does not activate optional persistent features the user did not request, widen the target set, or authorize destroy, prune, drop, overwrite, forced operation, failover, secret exposure, unrelated cleanup, or a materially different recovery action. Those remain separate operations under their own boundaries.

## Resolve Every Identity

Build an identity map appropriate to the task:

| Layer | Record |
|---|---|
| Orchestration origin | local workstation or automation runner, current directory, session/SSH hop, and approved artifact source/destination |
| Controller | host, user, executable, OBD version, `OBD_HOME`, active tasks |
| Target host | management address, hostname/machine identity, SSH user/port, OS and architecture |
| Deployment | OBD deployment name, product form, app/cluster identity, current state |
| Component | exact component key, version, release, architecture, artifact hash, plugin |
| Runtime target | server, zone, service/process, paths, ports, unit or container identity |
| Data target | tenant, backup set, SCN/time, repository object, storage prefix, or credential set |

Use the exact registered name for an existing deployment and follow the installed command's documented naming rules for a new one. Do not rewrite a legacy name or construct controller metadata paths manually.

Deduplicate physical hosts by observed host identity, not only by IP. Normalize paths and detect symbolic links, mount boundaries, overlaps, and non-empty targets before a file-affecting operation. Re-resolve the map whenever the shell, SSH hop, current user, executable, `OBD_HOME`, deployment, target list, or artifact path changes; authorization bound to the former identity does not carry over.

### Default Controller, SSH, and Cluster Discovery

For an OBD-based cluster deployment, preserve the user's target-host order. Unless the user explicitly selected a separate controller, the controller must be one of those cluster deployment hosts. Before choosing or installing it, inspect every reachable target for `obd` executables, package-manager ownership, candidate controller homes under the unchanged login environment, registered deployments, and active tasks. Prefer the target host whose registration identifies the intended deployment. If there is no such registration, reuse an otherwise unambiguous usable OBD installation on a target host. If multiple target hosts remain plausible controllers with conflicting or unrelated state, present the observed ambiguity and ask only after completing the safe inspection.

Only when every supplied cluster host has been reached and confirmed to contain no OBD executable, package record, controller metadata, or registration may the workflow select the first supplied host and install OBD there. Run the reviewed first-install command with the package manager's normal non-interactive acceptance option, such as `-y`, without asking the user to approve that command. This default applies to configuration-file and maximum-utilization autodeploy workflows with either online repositories or local packages. It does not authorize replacement, upgrade, downgrade, an unproved package candidate, or a broad repository rewrite. Do not install or run OBD on the automation runner as a fallback. A host that is unreachable has not been confirmed empty.

Resolve one login user for the deployment machines: use the user explicitly supplied by the user, or `root` when no login user was supplied. When no authentication material was supplied, first attempt bounded non-interactive passwordless login as that user with the runner's existing approved key or agent and password prompts disabled. If the runner cannot reach or administer an exact target through any already-approved path, record whether the failure was name resolution, route, timeout, host-key, authentication, or remote execution and request only the missing access information. Do not guess alternate users, passwords, private keys, privilege escalation, or tunnels. Use supplied authentication material only through its approved protected path.

After login, use the successful login-session user as the single identity for all subsequent operations on that machine. Record it with `id -un`, resolve its home through the account database, and keep OBD installation and execution, `OBD_HOME`, controller files, host preparation, and controller-to-node SSH under that user. Do not infer, create, or switch to a second OBD execution user. Use narrowly scoped privilege escalation only for a command that requires it; it must not change the OBD/controller owner.

After selecting the controller, test bounded non-interactive SSH from its login-session user to the same login user on every other deployment node. If that test fails only because passwordless authentication is absent, the deployment request authorizes the workflow to configure it without another prompt, provided the runner or supplied credentials already give verified administrative access to the exact target:

1. Reuse a suitable public key owned by the controller login-session user. Otherwise generate a dedicated non-overwriting Ed25519 keypair in that user's resolved SSH directory with an empty key passphrase and strict private-key permissions; never replace an existing key or copy a private key off the controller.
2. Read the target account's existing SSH state, create its `.ssh` directory or `authorized_keys` only when absent, and append the exact controller public-key line only when that key is not already present. Preserve every existing line, owner, account policy, and unrelated file; enforce the account-appropriate directory and file permissions.
3. Preserve host-key verification. Add trust only for the independently resolved target identity, and stop on a changed or conflicting host key rather than disabling checking.
4. Retest from the same controller login-session user to the same login user on the target with password prompts disabled, verify the remote machine identity and username, and record the controller key fingerprint plus every target whose file changed.

This bootstrap does not authorize password changes, account creation, `sshd_config` or firewall changes, root-login policy changes, private-key transfer, replacement or deletion of `authorized_keys`, SSH-agent forwarding, privilege escalation that was not already available, or any tunnel. If one of those would be required, the target is locked or ambiguous, or the existing administrative path cannot make the bounded append, stop and request the missing access or decision; do not ask merely for permission to perform the already-authorized public-key append.

A deployment request includes read-only discovery needed to determine existing state. Do not ask the user whether the cluster is deployed, whether a host is clean, or which target owns it before checking. Correlate candidate-controller registrations and deployment status with target-host package/service records, processes, listeners, expected or discovered deployment directories, and SQL/obshell identity when safely reachable. No single missing layer proves absence: an unregistered runtime can be unmanaged, a registered deployment can be stopped, and stopped processes can leave deployment data. Classify the result as registered and running, registered and stopped/partial, unmanaged or conflicting, or absent. Ask the user only for failed access or a material identity/ownership decision that remains after those observations; ask for that missing decision, not for facts the workflow can inspect.

### Resolve the Controller Home Without Guessing

Start from the caller's actual environment and record whether `OBD_HOME` is unset or explicitly configured. Correlate the exact executable and controller user with public inventory, registered deployment metadata, and trace locations under that unchanged environment before naming the controlling home.

Do not export a path merely because it looks like the default metadata directory. For example, observing `/root/.obd` does not justify setting `OBD_HOME=/root/.obd`; an installed build can derive another `.obd` child and resolve `/root/.obd/.obd`. Set or replace `OBD_HOME` only when the user, runner configuration, or proved existing controller identity requires it. After an explicit setting, verify the resolved registration and trace location and stop on an unexpected nested suffix, empty deployment inventory, ownership mismatch, or competing controller home.

Keep the resolved environment unchanged for every command and trace that belongs to one operation. Re-resolve it after an SSH hop, user or executable change, or automation-worker handoff; never switch homes merely to find a missing deployment or trace.

## Keep Remote Execution Identities Stable

For a workflow that manages remote hosts, distinguish the automation runner or workstation from the OBD controller, artifact-acquisition host, and managed hosts. For cluster deployment, select the controller through the target-host discovery rule above; for another remote workflow, select an approved remote host. Install and run OBD there. Keep its `OBD_HOME`, deployment metadata, traces, package resolution, and lifecycle commands on that controller unless the user explicitly chooses a different control-plane location. The runner is transport and evidence-capture infrastructure by default, not an implicit fallback controller.

In a remote workflow, an unqualified **local repository**, **local package**, **local path**, or **local download** means controller-local. Do not reinterpret it as runner-local merely because a network, proxy, repository, or package command failed.

Do not silently change the controller or execution host after a failure. For online packages from the OceanBase public repositories, the fixed [artifact-source workflow](../obd-administration/references/mirror-and-repositories.md#fixed-online-package-source-order) takes precedence over generic connectivity diagnosis: select the effective source before the acquisition mechanism, make the first actual package request to `https://mirrors.oceanbase.com`, remain on that source for up to three meaningful attempts, then use the direct package directories under `https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase`. While staying on the current source, vary applicable controller-local OBD/tool, `curl`, `wget`, or package-manager mechanisms and prove the effective package URL for each. A `.repo` file is configuration rather than a package source, and an operating-system dependency repository is a separate channel. Verify and import/register the exact artifact locally before retrying. Never use `obd mirror` as a network downloader.

Only after the complete controller-local suffix-by-source-and-mechanism matrix is exhausted may another reachable host become a bounded checksummed artifact relay for the same exact artifact from the same ordered sources. The relay must transfer the artifact to the existing controller for verification and local import/install; it does not become the controller and must not run OBD or the requested operation. Ask the user only after that relay also fails, or before introducing an unlisted source or different controller.

For non-package transfers, make bounded, meaningful attempts through applicable existing or user-approved routes on the same controller and preserve evidence for each route rather than blindly repeating one request. A user-approved relay may acquire, verify, and transfer an exact artifact; it does not move OBD or its metadata off the remote controller unless the user separately and explicitly changes that requirement.

## Minimize Scope

Resolve selectors to explicit objects before execution. Show selected and unselected servers, components, services, tenants, paths, repositories, or storage prefixes. Do not widen a server-, component-, service-, or tenant-scoped request to an entire deployment without explaining why and obtaining authorization for the wider impact.

Both full long options and documented short aliases are allowed in reusable commands when the selected subcommand's installed help confirms their exact mapping. Short options can have different meanings across OBD subcommands, so never transfer an alias from another command. Follow a domain workflow when it requires the long form to avoid a specific ambiguity or safety risk.

## Classify Mutations

Treat these as separate risk classes:

- data destruction or overwrite;
- availability impact, restart, role change, or failover;
- deployment configuration, repository, or artifact replacement;
- persistent host, account, systemd, kernel, limit, or runtime-environment change;
- secret exposure or replacement;
- network listener, firewall, whitelist, download, or other external side effect.

Immediately before a high-impact mutation, state the exact target, observed current state, intended change, impact, rollback or recovery boundary, and validation plan. For a requested non-destructive workflow, this record does not trigger duplicate confirmation for its intrinsic persistent changes. Obtain new authorization only when the action is destructive, forced, materially broader than the request, or belongs to another risk class that the request did not cover.

## Protect Credentials and Evidence

Prefer protected interactive input, permission-controlled files, or a version-supported secret reference. If the installed version only accepts a secret through process arguments, disclose that exposure and require an approved local execution method; do not embed the value in the skill or report.

Never “fix” exposure by deleting an entire shell history or unrelated logs. Redact field values in command displays, traces, YAML, URIs, and reports while preserving non-secret identity and error evidence.

## Account for Discovery Side Effects

Some discovery commands can update repository metadata, download packages, prompt for installation, or persist controller settings. Use the installed command's normal inventory/help path, record any resulting setup or package change, and surface a material side effect before proceeding when it falls outside the requested task. Tool setup does not by itself broaden the authorized diagnostic or operational target.

## Produce an Execution Record

Before execution, record:

1. the resolved identities and current state;
2. the exact command or API request with secrets redacted;
3. the intended state transition and affected objects;
4. expected persistent and temporary side effects;
5. completion checks and the failure stop condition.

After execution, record observed state rather than merely repeating command output.

For unattended or multi-stage work, read [non-interactive automation execution](automation-execution.md) before the first command and use its runtime preflight, prompt handling, structured event record, and timeout-reconciliation rules.
